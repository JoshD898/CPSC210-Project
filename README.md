# CPSC 210 Project - Simple Art Gallery

## Phase 0

### Project Description

The application will function as a basic art gallery. Users will be able to create and edit drawings, then publish those drawings to their personal gallery. The intended audience is people interested in experimenting with digital art.

This project interests me because I enjoy drawing, and I believe it will be a great way to improve my Java skills.

*Note: I think that implementing an interface that allows users to draw may be beyond the scope of this project. I may attempt it, but initially, I will simplify the process by representing a "drawing" as a square. Users will be able to modify the color and size of the square.*
