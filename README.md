# Simple Art Gallery - CPSC 210 Project

**Simple Art Gallery** is a basic Java-based desktop application built for a university course (CPSC 210). The goal of the project was to practice object-oriented design and gain experience developing a functional graphical user interface using Java Swing.

The application allows users to create, edit, and manage simple "drawings" — represented as customizable rectangles — within a personal gallery (see `USER STORIES.md` for more features). Although minimal in design, it demonstrates core Java programming skills including:

- Object-oriented principles
- File I/O and persistent data storage
- Logging
- GUI development using the Java Swing library
